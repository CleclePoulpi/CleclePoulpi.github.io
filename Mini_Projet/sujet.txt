In this last lab session of the "Client Side Web Programming" sequence, you will start a small individual project assessing all 
you've learned so far. This project is due on Febuary 27th 8AM (see deposit area below).


GOAL : You are asked to produce a web page displaying the weather conditions for 10 random users on a map.

The random (french) users will be generated by calls to the randomUser.me API. This API unfortunately gives wrong 
coordinates (there are not consistent with the city name...). So you will have to convert the city name into coordinates 
(geocode) with this geocoding API

The weather condition for a specific longitude / latitude  will be given by open-meteo.com API.
The weather conditions must be displayed on a map provided by the leaflet library, as a marker.
Every second, a new user is picked (and the weather condition of his location is displayed. Thus, you will create a growing list of 
markers. When this list reaches 10 elements, the first element is poped out as the last element is pushed in. Consequently, 
you will constantly have a list of 10 markers completly renewed every 10 seconds.


What skill is evaluated?

Your ability to produce documented, maintainable and comprehensive code.
Your ability to handle asynchronous code.
Your capability to search and comprehend APIs.


BONUS (nice to have fonctionalities):

Weather conditions are displayed on the map as an image (you may use this sprite)
Extended weather info of a location (for example, the evolution of temperature at this location)is displayed when a marker 
is clicked. (you may use : <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>)
